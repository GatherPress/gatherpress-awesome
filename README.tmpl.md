A starter plugin for GatherPress companion plugin development.

## Already prepared for your GatherPress project_name plugin

- [x] Test [GatherPress project_name in Playground](https://playground.wordpress.net/builder/builder.html?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/author_name/project_urlname/main/.wordpress-org/blueprints/blueprint.json), with GatherPress installed & project_name already in place.

### Up to you

- [ ] [Create your own GatherPress project_name demo-data](https://github.com/carstingaxion/crud-the-docs-playground), and add it to your [`blueprint.json`](/.wordpress-org/blueprints/blueprint.json).

- **collaboratively work** on a compagnion-plugin for GatherPress

- extend GatherPress' standard **scenarios using your plugin or theme**
