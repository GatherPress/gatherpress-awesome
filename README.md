# GatherPress Awesome

A starter plugin for GatherPress companion plugin development.

## Already prepared for your GatherPress Awesome plugin

- [x] Test [GatherPress Awesome in Playground](https://playground.wordpress.net/builder/builder.html?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GatherPress/gatherpress-awesome/main/.wordpress-org/blueprints/blueprint.json), with GatherPress installed & demo-data already in place.

### Up to you

- [ ] [Create your own GatherPress Awesome demo-data](https://github.com/carstingaxion/crud-the-docs-playground), and add it to your [`blueprint.json`](/.wordpress-org/blueprints/blueprint.json).


## You should create a new repository from [this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=gatherpress-awesome&template_owner=GatherPress) for yourself, if you'd like to ...

- **collaboratively work** on a compagnion-plugin for GatherPress

- extend GatherPress' standard **scenarios using your plugin or theme**

- see how GatherPress works & test its extendebility.

### Ready in 10 seconds

Creating a new repository from [this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=gatherpress-awesome&template_owner=GatherPress) lets you start immediately, because all paths, folder names etc. will be replaced to match the URLs of your new created repo. *Enjoy!*

This happens within an automated first commit directly after the repo gets initialised. So, please calm for 10 seconds and finally refresh the page.
